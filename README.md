**KmPlot** is a program to plot graphs of functions, their integrals or derivatives. The graphs can be colorized and the view is highly configurable, is scalable, and can be zoomed. The program features a powerful mathematical parser, different plot types (*cartesian*, *parametric*, *polar*, *implicit*, *differential*), and provides simple mathematical tools like for finding *maximum*/*minimum* of a function and plotting *derivatives* and *integral*. Parametrized functions can be visualized by adjusting the variable parameter via a slider. Plots can be exported as bitmap format pictures (*BMP*, *PNG*) or scalable vector graphics (*SVG*) and can be printed.
